#GrandeGifts

GrandeGifts is a fictional company that I have created a website for. The main task was to create a shopping cart system that allowed a user to buy purchase hampers.

It was assigned to me as a project by TafeNSW as a way for me to demonstrate my skills by creating an ASP.NET Core web application with an accompaning react native app, and angular 6 interface.

Instruction to run/view each of the projects are listed inside each projects' README.

The Required Use Cases were implimented into the ASP.Net WebApp over 3 sprints to simulate working in an industry environment:

Membership User Stories:
1. As a customer, I want to be able to register.
2. As a customer, I want to be able to login.
3. As a customer, I want to be able to logout.
4. As a customer, I want to be able to update my profile.
5. As an admin, I want to be able to login so that I can manage hampers in the system.
6. As an admin, I want to be able to logout.

Admin User Stories:
1. As an admin, I want to be able to add new category by specifying the category name, so that the customers can search for hampers ina selected category.
2. As an admin, I want to be able to update category by changing the category name.
3. As an admin, I want to be able to add new gift hampers by specifying the hamper name, category, price, picture and details, so that the customers can search for hampers stored in the system.
4. As an admin, I want to be able to update the existing hampers details including its name, category, price, and description so that the information will always be accurate.
5. As an admin, I want to be able to discontinue existing hampers from the system, so that the customers will not be able to find retired hampers in the system.

Customer User Stories:
1. As a customer, I want to search for existing hampers by the category, so that I can easily find all hampers in that category.
2. As a customer, I want to be able to filter the search results by minimum and maximum price, so that I can easily find all hampers that match with my search criteria.
3. As a customer, I want to be able to manage my favourite delivery addresses so that I can add an address, update an address, and remove an address.
4. As a customer, I want to order hampers and choose a delivery address from my favourite address list.  

Additional functionality has been added into the project that hasn't been listed here. 

The Angular and React Natvie projects are both only one page applications that alow the user to search for hampers based on the category it belongs in.

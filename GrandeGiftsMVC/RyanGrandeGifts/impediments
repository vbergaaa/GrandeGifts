priority 1 - Needs a solution
- calling an empty dataservice constructor to pass in DbContext config

priority 2 - found a work around but wanna improve

priority 3 - curious
- Do i need to validate a users identity when they are updating a address/booking
	- i made the key appear in the url but should only ever be visible to the owner
	- should i create a display key that is used to show a hamper and have a different one to update/delete that is hidden from public

- Should i set up a claim to allow ordering only after an address is created?
	- is that the right use of a claim? dont think i need to impliment can just add address at ordertime

- Tostring in model. where should it go? Inside a Helper class?
- State enum

var (totalquanity, totalprice) = GetShopppingCartItems();
